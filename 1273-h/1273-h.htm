</blockquote>
<p>I was born on the 2nd September, 1886, in a small, dull,
country town.&nbsp; When I say the town was dull, I mean, of
course, that the inhabitants were unenterprising, for in itself
Muddleton was a picturesque place, and though it laboured under
the usual disadvantage of a dearth of bachelors and a superfluity
of spinsters, it might have been pleasant enough had it not been
a favourite resort for my kith and kin.</p>
<p>My father has long enjoyed a world-wide notoriety; he is not,
however, as a rule named in good society, though he habitually
frequents it; and as I am led to believe that my autobiography
will possibly be circulated by Mr. Mudie, and will lie about on
drawing-room tables, I will merely mention that a most
representation of my progenitor, under his <i>nom de
th&eacute;atre</i>, Mephistopheles, may be seen now in London,
and I should recommend all who wish to understand his character
to go to the Lyceum, though, between ourselves, he strongly
disapproves of the whole performance.</p>
<p>I was introduced into the world by an old lady named Mrs.
O&rsquo;Reilly.&nbsp; She was a very pleasant old lady, the wife
of a General, and one of those sociable, friendly, talkative
people who do much to cheer their neighbours, particularly in a
deadly-lively provincial place like Muddleton, where the standard
of social intercourse is not very high.&nbsp; Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly
had been in her day a celebrated beauty; she was now grey-haired
and stout, but still there was something impressive about her,
and few could resist the charm of her manner and the pleasant
easy flow of her small talk.&nbsp; Her love of gossip amounted
almost to a passion, and nothing came amiss to her; she liked to
know everything about everybody, and in the main I think her
interest was a kindly one, though she found that a little bit of
scandal, every now and then, added a piquant flavour to the
homely fare provided by the commonplace life of the
Muddletonians.</p>
<p>I will now, without further preamble, begin the history of my
life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you, my dear Lena, Mr. Zaluski is nothing less
than a Nihilist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound waves set in motion by Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s
words were tumultuously heaving in the atmosphere when I sprang
into being, a young but perfectly formed and most promising
slander.&nbsp; A delicious odour of tea pervaded the
drawing-room, it was orange-flower pekoe, and Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly
was just handing one of the delicate Crown Derby cups to her
visitor, Miss Lena Houghton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a shocking thing!&nbsp; Do you really mean
it?&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Houghton.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you, cream
but no sugar; don&rsquo;t you know, Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly, that it
is only Low-Church people who take sugar nowadays?&nbsp; But,
really, now, about Mr. Zaluski?&nbsp; How did you find it
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I am an old woman, and I have learnt in the
course of a wandering life to put two and two together,&rdquo;
said Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly.&nbsp; She had somehow managed to ignore
middle age, and had passed from her position of renowned beauty
to the position which she now firmly and constantly claimed of
many years and much experience.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo;
she continued, &ldquo;like every one else, I was glad enough to
be friendly and pleasant to Sigismund Zaluski, and as to his
being a Pole, why, I think it rather pleased me than
otherwise.&nbsp; You see, my dear, I have knocked about the world
and mixed with all kinds of people.&nbsp; Still, one must draw
the line somewhere, and I confess it gave me a very painful shock
to find that he had such violent antipathies to law and
order.&nbsp; When he took Ivy Cottage for the summer I made the
General call at once, and before long we had become very intimate
with him; but, my dear, he&rsquo;s not what I thought
him&mdash;not at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, I am delighted to hear you say that,&rdquo;
said Lena Houghton, with some excitement in her manner,
&ldquo;for it exactly fits in with what I always felt about
him.&nbsp; From the first I disliked that man, and the way he
goes on with Gertrude Morley is simply dreadful.&nbsp; If they
are not engaged they ought to be&mdash;that&rsquo;s all I can
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Engaged, my dear!&nbsp; I trust not,&rdquo; said Mrs.
O&rsquo;Reilly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had always hoped for something
very different for dear Gertrude.&nbsp; Quite between ourselves,
you know, my nephew John Carew is over head and ears in love with
her, and they would make a very good pair; don&rsquo;t you think
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, I like Gertrude to a certain
extent,&rdquo; replied Lena Houghton.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I never
raved about her as so many people do.&nbsp; Still, I hope she
will not be entrapped into marrying Mr. Zaluski; she deserves a
better fate than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you,&rdquo; said Mrs.
O&rsquo;Reilly, with a troubled look.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the worst
of it is, poor Gertrude is a girl who might very likely take up
foolish revolutionary notions; she needs a strong wise husband to
keep her in order and form her opinions.&nbsp; But is it really
true that he flirts with her?&nbsp; This is the first I have
heard of it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think how it has escaped my
notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I, for indeed he is up at the Morleys&rsquo; pretty
nearly every day.&nbsp; What with tennis, and music, and riding,
there is always some excuse for it.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think
what Gertrude sees in him, he is not even
good-looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a certain surface good-nature about
him,&rdquo; said Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It deceived
even me at first.&nbsp; But, my dear Lena, mark my words: that
man has a fearful temper; and I pray Heaven that poor Gertrude
may have her eyes opened in time.&nbsp; Besides, to think of that
little gentle, delicate thing marrying a Nihilist!&nbsp; It is
too dreadful; really, quite too dreadful!&nbsp; John would never
get over it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing I can&rsquo;t understand is why all the world
has taken him up so,&rdquo; said Lena Houghton.&nbsp; &ldquo;One
meets him everywhere, yet nobody seems to know anything about
him.&nbsp; Just because he has taken Ivy Cottage for four months,
and because he seems to be rich and good-natured, every one is
ready to run after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly, &ldquo;we
all like to be neighbourly, my dear, and a week ago I should have
been ready to say nothing but good of him.&nbsp; But now my eyes
have been opened.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you just how it
was.&nbsp; We were sitting here, just as you and I are now, at
afternoon tea; the talk had flagged a little, and for the sake of
something to say I made some remark about Bulgaria&mdash;not that
I really knew anything about it, you know, for I&rsquo;m no
politician; still, I knew it was a subject that would make talk
just now.&nbsp; My dear, I assure you I was positively
frightened.&nbsp; All in a minute his face changed, his eyes
flashed, he broke into such a torrent of abuse as I never heard
in my life before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that he abused you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, no! but Russia and the Czar, and tyranny and
despotism, and many other things I had never heard of.&nbsp; I
tried to calm him down and reason with him, but I might as well
have reasoned with the cockatoo in the window.&nbsp; At last he
caught himself up quickly in the middle of a sentence, strode
over to the piano, and began to play as he generally does, you
know, when he comes here.&nbsp; Well, would you believe it, my
dear! instead of improvising or playing operatic airs as usual,
he began to play a stupid little tune which every child was
taught years ago, of course with variations of his own.&nbsp;
Then he turned round on the music-stool with the oddest smile I
ever saw, and said, &ldquo;Do you know that air, Mrs.
O&rsquo;Reilly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but I forget now what it
is.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was composed by Pestal, one of the victims of
Russian tyranny,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;The executioner did
his work badly, and Pestal had to be strung up twice.&nbsp; In
the interval he was heard to mutter, &lsquo;Stupid country, where
they don&rsquo;t even know how to hang!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he gave a little forced laugh, got up quickly,
wished me good-bye, and was gone before I could put in a
word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a horrible story to tell in a drawing-room!&rdquo;
said Lena Houghton.&nbsp; &ldquo;I envy Gertrude less than
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor girl!&nbsp; What a sad prospect it is for
her!&rdquo; said Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly with a sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course, my dear, you&rsquo;ll not repeat what I have just told
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the world!&rdquo; said Lena Houghton
emphatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is perfectly safe with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation was here abruptly ended, for the page threw
open the drawing-room door and announced &lsquo;Mr.
Zaluski.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk of the angel,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly
with a significant smile at her companion.&nbsp; Then skilfully
altering the expression of her face, she beamed graciously on the
guest who was ushered into the room, and Lena Houghton also
prepared to greet him most pleasantly.</p>
<p>I looked with much interest at Sigismund Zaluski, and as I
looked I partly understood why Miss Houghton had been prejudiced
against him at first sight.&nbsp; He had lived five years in
England, and nothing pleased him more than to be taken for an
Englishman.&nbsp; He had had his silky black hair closely cropped
in the very hideous fashion of the present day; he wore the
ostentatiously high collar now in vogue; and he tried to be
sedulously English in every respect.&nbsp; But in spite of his
wonderfully fluent speech and almost perfect accent, there
lingered about him something which would not harmonise with that
ideal of an English gentleman which is latent in most
minds.&nbsp; Something he lacked, something he possessed, which
interfered with the part he desired to play.&nbsp; The something
lacking showed itself in his ineradicable love of jewellery and
in a transparent habit of fibbing; the something possessed showed
itself in his easy grace of movement, his delightful readiness to
amuse and to be amused, and in a certain cleverness and rapidity
of idea rarely, if ever, found in an Englishman.</p>
<p>He was a little above the average height and very finely
built; but there was nothing striking in his aquiline features
and dark grey eyes, and I think Miss Houghton spoke truly when
she said that he was &lsquo;Not even good-looking.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Still, in spite of this, it was a face which grew upon most
people, and I felt the least little bit of regret as I looked at
him, because I knew that I should persistently haunt and harass
him, and should do all that could be done to spoil his life.</p>
<p>Apparently he had forgotten all about Russia and Bulgaria, for
he looked radiantly happy.&nbsp; Clearly his thoughts were
engrossed with his own affairs, which, in other words, meant with
Gertrude Morley; and though, as I have since observed, there are
times when a man in love is an altogether intolerable sort of
being, there are other times when he is very much improved by the
passion, and regards the whole world with a genial kindliness
which contrasts strangely with his previous cool cynicism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How delightful and home-like your room always
looks!&rdquo; he exclaimed, taking the cup of tea which Mrs.
O&rsquo;Reilly handed to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am horribly lonely
at Ivy Cottage.&nbsp; This house is a sort of oasis in the
desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you are hardly ever at home, I thought,&rdquo;
said Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are the lion
of the neighbourhood just now; and I&rsquo;m sure it is very good
of you to come in and cheer a lonely old woman.&nbsp; Are you
going to play me something rather more lively to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Poor Pestal!&nbsp; I had forgotten all about
our last meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were very much excited that day,&rdquo; said Mrs.
O&rsquo;Reilly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had no idea that your political
notions&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He interrupted her</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! no politics to-day, dear Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly.&nbsp;
Let us have nothing but enjoyment and harmony.&nbsp; See, now, I
will play you something very much more cheerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And sitting down to the piano, he played the bridal march from
&lsquo;Lohengrin,&rsquo; then wandered off into an improvised
air, and finally treated them to some recollections of the
&lsquo;Mikado.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lena-Houghton watched him thoughtfully as she put on her
gloves; he was playing with great spirit, and the words of the
opera rang in her ears:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>For he&rsquo;s going to marry Yum-yum, Yum-yum,<br
/>
And so you had better be dumb, dumb, dumb!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I knew well enough that she would not follow this moral
advice, and I laughed to myself because the whole scene was such
a hollow mockery.&nbsp; The placid benevolent-looking old lady
leaning back in her arm-chair; the girl in her blue gingham and
straw hat preparing to go to the afternoon service; the happy
lover entering heart and soul into Sullivan&rsquo;s charming
music; the pretty room with its Chippendale furniture, its
&aelig;sthetic hangings, its bowls of roses; and the sound of
church bells wafted through the open window on the soft summer
breeze.</p>
<p>Yet all the time I lingered there unseen, carrying with me all
sorts of dread possibilities.&nbsp; I had been introduced into
the world, and even if Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly had been willing to
admit to herself that she had broken the ninth commandment, and
had earnestly desired to recall me, all her sighs and tears and
regrets would have availed nothing; so true is the saying,
&ldquo;Of thy word unspoken thou art master; thy spoken word is
master of thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;How I envy your power of playing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two ladies seemed to vie with each other in making pretty
speeches, and Zaluski, who loved music and loved giving pleasure,
looked really pleased.&nbsp; I am sure it did not enter his head
that his two companions were not sincere, or that they did not
wish him well.&nbsp; He was thinking to himself how simple and
kindly the Muddleton people were, and how great a contrast this
life was to his life in London; and he was saying to himself that
he had been a fool to live a lonely bachelor life till he was
nearly thirty, and yet congratulating himself that he had done so
since Gertrude was but nineteen.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, he was seeing
blissful visions of the future all the time that he replied to
the pretty speeches, and shook hands with Lena Houghton, and
opened the drawing-room door for her, and took out his watch to
assure her that she had plenty of time and need not hurry to
church.</p>
<p>Poor Zaluski!&nbsp; He looked so kindly and pleasant.&nbsp;
Though I was only a slander, and might have been supposed to have
no heart at all, I did feel sorry for him when I thought of the
future and of the grief and pain which would persistently dog his
steps.</p>
<h2>MY SECOND STAGE</h2>
<blockquote><p>Bear not false witness, slander not, nor lie;<br
/>
Truth is the speech of inward purity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>The Light of Asia</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my first stage the reader will perceive that I was a
comparatively weak and harmless little slander, with merely that
taint of original sin which was to be expected in one of such
parentage.&nbsp; But I developed with great rapidity; and I
believe men of science will tell you that this is always the case
with low organisms.&nbsp; That, for instance, while it takes
years to develop the man from the baby, and months to develop the
dog from the puppy, the baby monad will grow to maturity in an
hour.</p>
<p>Personally I should have preferred to linger in Mrs.
O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s pleasant drawing-room, for, as I said
before, my victim interested me, and I wanted to observe him more
closely and hear what he talked about.&nbsp; But I received
orders to attend evensong at the parish church, and to haunt the
mind of Lena Houghton.</p>
<p>As we passed down the High Street the bells rang out loud and
clear, and they made me feel the same slight sense of discomfort
that I had felt when I looked at Zaluski; however, I went on, and
soon entered the church.&nbsp; It was a fine old Gothic building,
and the afternoon sunshine seemed to flood the whole place; even
the white stones in the aisle were glorified here and there with
gorgeous patches of colour from the stained glass windows.&nbsp;
But the strange stillness and quiet oppressed me, I did not feel
nearly so much at home as in Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s
drawing-room&mdash;to use a terrestrial simile, I felt like a
fish out of water.</p>
<p>For some time, too, I could find no entrance at all into the
mind of Lena Houghton.&nbsp; Try as I would, I could not distract
her attention or gain the slightest hold upon her, and I really
believe I should have been altogether baffled, had not the rector
unconsciously come to my aid.</p>
<p>All through the prayers and psalms I had fought a desperate
fight without gaining a single inch.&nbsp; Then the rector walked
over to the lectern, and the moment he opened his mouth I knew
that my time had come, and that there was a very fair chance of
victory before me.&nbsp; Whether this clergyman had a toothache,
or a headache, or a heavy load on his mind, I cannot say, but his
reading was more lugubrious than the wind in an equinoctial
gale.&nbsp; I have since observed that he was only a degree worse
than many other clerical readers, and that a strange and
delightfully mistaken notion seems prevalent that the Bible must
be read in a dreary and unnatural tone of voice, or with a sort
of mournful monotony; it is intended as a sort of reverence, but
I suspect that it often plays into the hands of my progenitor, as
it most assuredly did in the present instance.</p>
<p>Hardly had the rector announced, &ldquo;Here beginneth the
forty-fourth verse of the sixteenth chapter of the book of the
prophet Ezekiel,&rdquo; than a sort of relaxation took place in
the mind I was attacking.&nbsp; Lena Houghton&rsquo;s attention
could only have been given to the drearily read lesson by a very
great effort; she was a little lazy and did not make the effort,
she thought how nice it was to sit down again, and then the
melancholy voice lulled her into a vague interval of thoughtless
inactivity.&nbsp; I promptly seized my opportunity, and in a
moment her whole mind was full of me.&nbsp; She was an excitable,
impressionable sort of girl, and when once I had obtained an
entrance into her mind I found it the easiest thing in the world
to dominate her thoughts.&nbsp; Though she stood, and sat, and
knelt, and curtseyed, and articulated words, her thoughts were
entirely absorbed in me.&nbsp; I crowded out the Magnificat with
a picture of Zaluski and Gertrude Morley.&nbsp; I led her through
more terrible future possibilities in the second lesson than
would be required for a three-volume novel.&nbsp; I entirely
eclipsed the collects with reflections on unhappy marriages; took
her off <i>vi&acirc;</i> Russia and Nihilism in the State
prayers, and by the time we arrived at St. Chrysostom had become
so powerful that I had worked her mind into exactly the condition
I desired.</p>
<p>The congregation rose.&nbsp; Lena Houghton, still dominated by
me, knelt longer than the rest, but at last she got up and walked
down the aisle, and I felt a great sense of relief and
satisfaction.&nbsp; We were out in the open air once more, and I
had triumphed; I was quite sure that she would tell the first
person she met, for, as I have said before, she was entirely
taken up with me, and to have kept me to herself would have
required far more strength and unselfishness than she at that
moment possessed.&nbsp; She walked slowly through the churchyard,
feeling much pleased to see that the curate had just left the
vestry door, and that in a few moments their paths must
converge.</p>
<p>Mr. Blackthorne had only been ordained three or four years,
and was a little younger, and much less experienced in the ways
of the world, than Sigismund Zaluski.&nbsp; He was a good
well-meaning fellow, a little narrow, a little prejudiced, a
little spoiled by the devotion of the district visitors and
Sunday School teachers; but he was honest and energetic, and as a
worker among the poor few could have equalled him.&nbsp; He
seemed to fancy, however, that with the poor his work ended, and
he was not always so wise as he might have been in Muddleton
society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Miss Houghton,&rdquo; he
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you happen to know if your brother is
at home?&nbsp; I want just to speak to him about the choir
treat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is sure to be in by this time,&rdquo; said
Lena.</p>
<p>And they walked home together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad to have this chance of speaking to
you,&rdquo; she began rather nervously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wanted
particularly to ask your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blackthorne, being human and young, was not unnaturally
flattered by this remark.&nbsp; True, he was becoming well
accustomed to this sort of thing, since the ladies of Muddleton
were far more fond of seeking advice from the young and
good-looking curate than from the elderly and experienced
rector.&nbsp; They said it was because Mr. Blackthorne was so
much more sympathetic, and understood the difficulties of the day
so much better; but I think they unconsciously deceived
themselves, for the rector was one of a thousand, and the curate,
though he had in him the makings of a fine man, was as yet
altogether crude and young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it about anything in your district?&rdquo; he
asked, devoutly hoping that she was not going to propound some
difficult question about the origin of evil, or any other obscure
subject.&nbsp; For though he liked the honour of being consulted,
he did not always like the trouble it involved, and he remembered
with a shudder that Miss Houghton had once asked him his opinion
about the &lsquo;Ethical Concept of the Good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only that I was so troubled about something Mrs.
O&rsquo;Reilly has just told me,&rdquo; said Lena Houghton.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell any one that I told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On no account,&rdquo; said the curate, warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know Mr. Zaluski, and how the Morleys have
taken him up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one has taken him up,&rdquo; said the curate,
with the least little touch of resentment in his tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I knew that the Morleys were his special friends; I
imagine that he admires Miss Morley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, every one thinks they are either engaged or on the
brink of it.&nbsp; And oh, Mr. Blackthorne, can&rsquo;t you or
somebody put a stop to it, for it seems such a dreadful fate for
poor Gertrude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate looked startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t profess to like Mr. Zaluski,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know anything exactly
against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do.&nbsp; Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly has just been
telling me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she tell you?&rdquo; he asked with some
curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she has found out that he is really a
Nihilist&mdash;just think of a Nihilist going about loose like
this, and playing tennis at the rectory and all the good
houses!&nbsp; And not only that, but she says he is altogether a
dangerous, unprincipled man with a dreadful temper.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t think how unhappy she is about poor Gertrude, and so
am I, for we were at school together and have always been
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry to hear about it,&rdquo; said Mr.
Blackthorne, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see that anything can be
done.&nbsp; You see, one does not like to interfere in these sort
of things.&nbsp; It seems officious rather, and
meddlesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is the worst of it,&rdquo; she replied, with
a sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose we can do nothing.&nbsp; Still, it
has been a great relief just to tell you about it and get it off
my mind.&nbsp; I suppose we can only hope that something may put
a stop to it all&mdash;we must just leave it to
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sentiment amused me not a little.&nbsp; Leave it to
chance indeed!&nbsp; Had she not caused me to grow stronger and
larger by every word she uttered?&nbsp; And had not the
conversation revealed to me Mr. Blackthorn&rsquo;s one vulnerable
part?&nbsp; I knew well enough that I should be able to dominate
his thoughts as I had done hers.&nbsp; Finding me burdensome, she
had passed me on to somebody else with additions that vastly
increased my working powers, and then she talked of leaving it to
chance!&nbsp; The way in which mortals practise pious frauds on
themselves is really delightful!&nbsp; And yet Lena Houghton was
a good sort of girl, and had from her childhood repeated the
catechism words which proclaim that, &ldquo;My duty to my
neighbour is to love him as myself . . . To keep my tongue from
evil-speaking, lying, and slandering.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is more,
she took great pains to teach these words to a big class of
Sunday School children, and went, rain or shine, to spend two
hours each Sunday in a stuffy school-room for that purpose.&nbsp;
It was strange that she should be so ready to believe evil of her
neighbour, and so eager to spread the story.&nbsp; But my
progenitor is clever, and doubtless knows very well, whom to
select as his tools.</p>
<p>By this time they had reached a comfortable-looking, red-brick
house with white stone facings, and in the discussion of the
arrangements for the choir treat I was entirely forgotten.</p>
<h2>MY THIRD STAGE</h2>
<blockquote><p>Alas! such is our weakness, that we often more
readily believe and speak of another that which is evil than that
which is good.&nbsp; But perfect men do not easily give credit to
every report; because they know man&rsquo;s weakness, which is
very prone to evil, and very subject to fail in words.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>All through that evening, and through the first part of the
succeeding day, I was crowded out of the curate&rsquo;s mind by a
host of thoughts with which I had nothing in common; and though I
hovered about him as he taught in the school, and visited several
sick people, and argued with an habitual drunkard, and worked at
his Sunday sermon, a Power, which I felt but did not understand,
baffled all my attempts to gain an entrance and attract his
notice.&nbsp; I made a desperate attack on him after lunch as he
sat smoking and enjoying a well-earned rest, but it was of no
avail.&nbsp; I followed him to a large garden-party later on, but
to my great annoyance he went about talking to every one in the
pleasantest way imaginable, though I perceived that he was
longing to play tennis instead.</p>
<p>At length, however, my opportunity came.&nbsp; Mr. Blackthorne
was talking to the lady of the house, Mrs. Courtenay, when she
suddenly exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, here is Mr. Zaluski just arriving.&nbsp; I began to
be afraid that he had forgotten the day, and he is always such an
acquisition.&nbsp; How do you do, Mr. Zaluski?&rdquo; she said,
greeting my victim warmly as he stepped on to the terrace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So glad you were able to come.&nbsp; You know Mr.
Blackthorne, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zaluski greeted the curate pleasantly, and his dark eyes
lighted up with a gleam of amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we are great friends,&rdquo; he said
laughingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only, you know, I sometimes shock him a
little&mdash;just a very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very unkind of you, I am sure,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Courtenay, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; said Zaluski, with the audacity
of a privileged being.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is just my little
amusement, very harmless, very&mdash;what you call
innocent.&nbsp; Mr. Blackthorne cannot make up his mind about
me.&nbsp; One day I appear to him to be Catholic, the next
Comtist, the next Orthodox Greek, the next a convert to the
Anglican communion.&nbsp; I am a mystery, you see!&nbsp; And
mysteries are as indispensable in life as in a
romance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.&nbsp; Mrs. Courtenay laughed too, and a little
friendly banter was carried on between them, while the curate
stood by feeling rather out of it.</p>
<p>I drew nearer to him, perceiving that my prospects bid fair to
improve.&nbsp; For very few people can feel out of it without
drifting into a self-regarding mood, and then they are the
easiest prey imaginable.&nbsp; Undoubtedly a man like Zaluski,
with his easy nonchalance, his knowledge of the world, his
genuine good-nature, and the background of sterling qualities
which came upon you as a surprise because he loved to make
himself seem a mere idler, was apt to eclipse an ordinary mortal
like James Blackthorne.&nbsp; The curate perceived this and did
not like to be eclipsed&mdash;as a matter of fact, nobody
does.&nbsp; It seemed to him a little unfair that he, who had
hitherto been made much of, should be called to play second
fiddle to this rich Polish fellow who had never done anything for
Muddleton or the neighbourhood.&nbsp; And then, too, Sigismund
Zaluski had a way of poking fun at him which he resented, and
would not take in good part.</p>
<p>Something of this began to stir in his mind; and he cordially
hated the Pole when Jim Courtenay, who arranged the tennis, came
up and asked him to play in the next set, passing the curate by
altogether.</p>
<p>Then I found no difficulty at all in taking possession of him;
indeed he was delighted to have me brought back to his memory, he
positively gloated over me, and I grew apace.</p>
<p>Zaluski, in the seventh heaven of happiness, was playing with
Gertrude Morley, and his play was so good and so graceful that
every one was watching it with pleasure.&nbsp; His partner, too,
played well; she was a pretty, fair-haired girl, with soft grey
eyes like the eyes of a dove; she wore a white tennis dress and a
white sailor hat, and at her throat she had fastened a cluster of
those beautiful orange-coloured roses known by the prosaic name
of &lsquo;William Allan Richardson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If Mr. Blackthorne grew angry as he watched Sigismund Zaluski,
he grew doubly angry as he watched Gertrude Morley.&nbsp; He said
to himself that it was intolerable that such a girl should fall a
prey to a vain, shallow, unprincipled foreigner, and in a few
minutes he had painted such a dark picture of poor Sigismund that
my strength increased tenfold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Blackthorne,&rdquo; said Mrs. Courtenay,
&ldquo;would you take Mrs. Milton-Cleave to have an
ice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Mrs. Milton-Cleave had always been one of the
curate&rsquo;s great friends.&nbsp; She was a very pleasant,
talkative woman of six-and-thirty, and a general favourite.&nbsp;
Her popularity was well deserved, for she was always ready to do
a kind action, and often went out of her way to help people who
had not the slightest claim upon her.&nbsp; There was, however,
no repose about Mrs. Milton-Cleave, and an acute observer would
have discovered that her universal readiness to help was caused
to some extent by her good heart, but in a very large degree by
her restless and over-active brain.&nbsp; Her sphere was scarcely
large enough for her, she would have made an excellent head of an
orphan asylum or manager of some large institution, but her quiet
country life offered far too narrow a field for her energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really quite a treat to watch Mr. Zaluski&rsquo;s
play,&rdquo; she remarked as they walked to the refreshment tent
at the other end of the lawn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly foreigners
know how to move much better than we do: our best players look
awkward beside them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said Mr. Blackthorne.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am afraid I am full of prejudice, and consider that no
one can equal a true-born Briton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I quite agree with you in the main,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Milton-Cleave.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though I confess that it is
rather refreshing to have a little variety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate was silent, but his silence merely covered his
absorption in me, and I began to exercise a faint influence
through his mind on the mind of his companion.&nbsp; This caused
her at length to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you quite like Mr. Zaluski.&nbsp;
Do you know much about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have met him several times this summer,&rdquo; said
the curate, in the tone of one who could have said much more if
he would.</p>
<p>The less satisfying his replies, the more Mrs.
Milton-Cleave&rsquo;s curiosity grew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, tell me candidly,&rdquo; she said at length.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is there not some mystery about our new neighbour?&nbsp;
Is he quite what he seems to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear he is not,&rdquo; said Mr. Blackthorne, making
the admission in a tone of reluctance, though, to tell the truth,
he had been longing to pass me on for the last five minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that he is fast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than that,&rdquo; said James Blackthorne,
lowering his voice as they walked down one of the shady garden
paths.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a dangerous, unprincipled fellow, and
into the bargain an avowed Nihilist.&nbsp; All that is involved
in that word you perhaps scarcely realise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do,&rdquo; she exclaimed with a shocked
expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have just been reading a review of
that book by Stepniak.&nbsp; Their social and religious views are
terrible; free-love, atheism, everything that could bring ruin on
the human race.&nbsp; Is he indeed a Nihilist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blackthorne&rsquo;s conscience gave him a sharp prick, for
he knew that he ought not to have passed me on.&nbsp; He tried to
pacify it with the excuse that he had only promised not to tell
that Miss Houghton had been his informant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you,&rdquo; he said impressively, &ldquo;it is
only too true.&nbsp; I know it on the best authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here I cannot help remarking that it has always seemed to
me strange that even experienced women of the world, like Mrs.
Milton-Cleave, can be so easily hoodwinked by that vague
nonentity, &lsquo;The Best Authority.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am inclined
to think that were I a human being I should retort with an
expressive motion of the finger and thumb, &ldquo;Oh, you know it
on the best authority, do you?&nbsp; Then <i>that</i> for your
story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, I thrived wonderfully on the best authority, and it
would be ungrateful of me to speak evil of that powerful though
imaginary being.</p>
<p>At right angles with the garden walk down which the two were
pacing there was another wide pathway, bordered by high closely
clipped shrubs.&nbsp; Down this paced a very different
couple.&nbsp; Mrs. Milton-Cleave caught sight of them, and so did
curate.&nbsp; Mrs. Milton-Cleave sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid he is running after Gertrude Morley!&nbsp;
Poor girl!&nbsp; I hope she will not be deluded into encouraging
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then they made just the same little set remarks about the
desirability of stopping so dangerous an acquaintance, and the
impossibility of interfering with other people&rsquo;s affairs,
and the sad necessity of standing by with folded hands.&nbsp; I
laughed so much over their hollow little phrases that at last I
was fain to beat a retreat, and, prompted by curiosity to know a
little of the truth, I followed Sigismund and Gertrude down the
broad grassy pathway.</p>
<p>I knew of course a good deal of Zaluski&rsquo;s character,
because my own existence and growth pointed out what he was
not.&nbsp; Still, to study a man by a process of negation is
tedious, and though I knew that he was not a Nihilist, or a
free-lover, or an atheist, or an unprincipled fellow with a
dangerous temper, yet I was curious to see him as he really
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you only knew how happy you had made me!&rdquo; he
was saying.&nbsp; And indeed, as far as happiness went, there was
not much to choose between them, I fancy; for Gertrude Morley
looked radiant, and in her clove-like eyes there was the
reflection of the love which flashed in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must talk to my mother about it,&rdquo; she said
after a minute&rsquo;s silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, I am still
under age, and she and Uncle Henry my guardian must consent
before we are actually betrothed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see them at once,&rdquo; said Zaluski,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could see my mother,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But Uncle Henry is still in Sweden and will not be in town
for another week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must we really wait so long!&rdquo; sighed Sigismund
impatiently.</p>
<p>She laughed at him gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole week!&nbsp; But then we are sure of each
other.&nbsp; I do not think we ought to grumble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps they may think that a merchant is no
fitting match for you,&rdquo; he suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
nothing but a plain merchant, and my I people have been in the
same business for four generations.&nbsp; As far as wealth goes I
might perhaps satisfy your people, but for the rest I am but a
prosaic fellow, with neither noble blood, nor the brain of a
genius, nor anything out of the common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be enough for my mother that we love each
other,&rdquo; she said shyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be enough for him that you are upright and
honourable&mdash;enough that you are yourself,
Sigismund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were sitting now in a little sheltered recess clipped out
of the yew-trees.&nbsp; When that softly spoken
&ldquo;Sigismund&rdquo; fell from her lips, Zaluski caught her in
his arms and kissed her again and again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have led such a lonely life,&rdquo; he said after a
few minutes, during which their talk had baffled my
comprehension.&nbsp; &ldquo;All my people died while I was still
a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who brought you up?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An uncle of mine, the head of our firm in St.
Petersburg.&nbsp; He was very good to me, but he had children of
his own, and of course I could not be to him as one of
them.&nbsp; I have had many friends and much kindness shown to
me, but love!&mdash;none till to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then again they fell into the talk which I could not
fathom.&nbsp; And so I left them in their brief happiness, for my
time of idleness was over, and I was ordered to attend Mrs.
Milton-Cleave without a moment&rsquo;s delay.</p>
<h2>MY FOURTH STAGE</h2>
<blockquote><p>Oh, the little more, and how much it is!</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">R.

</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Milton-Cleave had one weakness&mdash;she was possessed by
an inordinate desire for influence.&nbsp; This made her always
eagerly anxious to be interesting both in her conversation and in
her letters, and to this end she exerted herself with unwearying
activity.&nbsp; She liked influencing Mr. Blackthorne, and spared
no pains on him that afternoon; and indeed the curate was a good
deal flattered by her friendship, and considered her one of the
most clever and charming women he had ever met.</p>
<p>Sigismund and Gertrude returned to the ordinary world just as
Mrs. Milton-Cleave was saying good-bye to the hostess.&nbsp; She
glanced at them searchingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Gertrude,&rdquo; she said a little
coldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you win at tennis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed we did,&rdquo; said Gertrude, smiling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We came off with flying colours.&nbsp; It was a love
set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was looking more beautiful than ever, and there was a
tell-tale colour in her cheeks and an unusual light in her soft
grey eyes.&nbsp; As for Zaluski, he was so evidently in love, and
had the audacity to look so supremely happy, that Mrs.
Milton-Cleave was more than ever impressed with the gravity of
the situation.&nbsp; The curate handed her into her victoria, and
she drove home through the sheltered lanes musing sadly over the
story she had heard, and wondering what Gertrude&rsquo;s future
would be.&nbsp; When she reached home, however, the affair was
driven from her thoughts by her children, of whom she was
devotedly fond.&nbsp; They came running to meet her, frisking
like so many kittens round her as she went upstairs to her room,
and begging to stay with her while she dressed for dinner.&nbsp;
During dinner she was engrossed with her husband; but afterwards,
when she was alone in the drawing-room, I found my opportunity
for working on her restless mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; she exclaimed, throwing aside the
newspaper she had just taken up, &ldquo;I ought to write to Mrs.
Selldon at Dulminster about that G.F.S. girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact she ought not to have written then, the
letter might well have waited till the morning, and she was
over-tired and needed rest.&nbsp; But I was glad to see her take
up her pen, for I knew I should come in most conveniently to fill
up the second side of the sheet.</p>
<p>Before long Jane Stiggins, the member who had migrated from
Muddleton to Dulminster, had been duly reported, wound up, and
made over to the Archdeacon&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Then the tired
hand paused.&nbsp; What more could she say to her friend?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are leading our usual quiet life here,&rdquo; she
wrote, &ldquo;with the ordinary round of tennis parties and
picnics to enliven us.&nbsp; The children have all been
wonderfully well, and I think you will see a great improvement in
your god-daughter when you next come to stay with
us&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Milton-Cleave,
&ldquo;how dull and stupid I am to-night!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
think of a single thing to say.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then at length I
flashed into her mind, and with a sigh of relief and a little
rising flush of excitement she went on much more rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is such a comfort to be quite at rest about them,
and to see them all looking so well.&nbsp; But I suppose one can
never be without some cause of worry, and just now I am very
unhappy about that nice girl Gertrude Morley whom you admired so
much when you were last here.&nbsp; The whole neighbourhood has
been dominated this year by a young Polish merchant named
Sigismund Zaluski, who is very clever and musical and knows well
how to win popularity.&nbsp; He has taken Ivy Cottage for four
mouths, and is, I fear, doing great mischief.&nbsp; The Morleys
are his special friends, and I greatly fear he is making love to
Gertrude.&nbsp; Now I know privately, on the very best authority,
that although he has so completely deceived every one and has
managed so cleverly to pose as a respectable man, that Mr.
Zaluski is really a Nihilist, a free-lover, an atheist, and
altogether a most unprincipled man.&nbsp; He is very clever, and
speaks English most fluently, indeed he has lived in London since
the spring of 1881&mdash;he told me so himself.&nbsp; I cannot
help fancying that he must have been concerned in the
assassination of the late Czar, which you will remember took
place in that year early in March.&nbsp; It is terrible to think
of the poor Morleys entering blindfold on such an undesirable
connection; but, at the same time, I really do not feel that I
can say anything about it.&nbsp; Excuse this hurried note, dear
Charlotte, and with love to yourself and kindest remembrances to
the Archdeacon,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, very affectionately yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Georgina
Milton-Cleave</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&nbsp; It may perhaps be as well not to mention
this affair about Gertrude Morley and Mr. Zaluski.&nbsp; They are
not yet engaged, as far as I know, and I sincerely trust it may
prove to be a mere flirtation.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I had now grown to such enormous dimensions that any one who
had known me in my infancy would scarcely have recognised me,
while naturally the more I grew the more powerful I became, and
the more capable both of impressing the minds which received me
and of injuring Zaluski.&nbsp; Poor Zaluski, who was so
foolishly, thoughtlessly happy!&nbsp; He little dreamed of the
fate that awaited him!&nbsp; His whole world was bright and full
of promise; each hour of love seemed to improve him, to deepen
his whole character, to tone down his rather flippant manner, to
awaken for him new and hitherto unthought-of realities.</p>
<p>But while he basked in his new happiness I travelled in my
close stuffy envelope to Dulminster, and after having been tossed
in and out of bags, shuffled, stamped, thumped, tied up, and
generally shaken about, I arrived one morning at Dulminster
Archdeaconry, and was laid on the breakfast table among other
appetising things to greet Mrs. Selldon when she came
downstairs.</p>
<h2>MY FIFTH STAGE</h2>
<blockquote><p>Also it is wise not to believe everything you
hear, not immediately to carry to the ears of others what you
have either heard or believed.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Thomas &Agrave;
Kempis</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though I was read in silence at the breakfast table and not
passed on to the Archdeacon, I lay dormant in Mrs.
Selldon&rsquo;s mind all day, and came to her aid that night when
she was at her wits&rsquo; end for something to talk about.</p>
<p>Mrs. Selldon, though a most worthy and estimable person, was
of a phlegmatic temperament; her sympathies were not easily
aroused, her mind was lazy and torpid, in conversation she was
unutterably dull.&nbsp; There were times when she was painfully
conscious of this, and would have given much for the ceaseless
flow of words which fell from the lips of her friend Mrs.
Milton-Cleave.&nbsp; And that evening after my arrival chanced to
be one of these occasions, for there was a dinner-party at the
Archdeaconry, given in honour of a well-known author who was
spending a few days in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could have Mr. Shrewsbury at your end of the
table, Thomas,&rdquo; Mrs. Selldon had remarked to her husband
with a sigh, as she was arranging the guests on paper that
afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he must certainly take you in, my dear,&rdquo; said
the Archdeacon.&nbsp; &ldquo;And he seems a very clever,
well-read man, I am sure you will find him easy to talk
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Mrs. Selldon thought that she would rather have had some
one who was neither clever nor well-read.&nbsp; But there was no
help for her, and, whether she would or not, she had to go in to
dinner with the literary lion.</p>
<p>Mr. Mark Shrewsbury was a novelist of great ability.&nbsp;
Some twenty years before, he had been called to the bar, and,
conscious of real talent, had been greatly embittered by the
impossibility of getting on in his profession.&nbsp; At length,
in disgust, he gave up all hopes of success and devoted himself
instead to literature.&nbsp; In this field he won the recognition
for which he craved; his books were read everywhere, his name
became famous, his income steadily increased, and he had the
pleasant consciousness that he had found his vocation.&nbsp;
Still, in spite of his success, he could not forget the bitter
years of failure and disappointment which had gone before, and
though his novels were full of genius they were pervaded by an
undertone of sarcasm, so that people after reading them were more
ready than before to take cynical views of life.</p>
<p>He was one of those men whose quiet impassive faces reveal
scarcely anything of their character.&nbsp; He was neither tall
nor short, neither dark nor fair, neither handsome nor the
reverse; in fact his personality was not in the least impressive;
while, like most true artists, he observed all things so quietly
that you rarely discovered that he was observing at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; people would say, &ldquo;Is Mark
Shrewsbury really here?&nbsp; Which is he?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
see any one at all like my idea of a novelist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is&mdash;that man in spectacles,&rdquo; would
be the reply.</p>
<p>And really the spectacles were the only noteworthy thing about
him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Selldon, who had seen several authors and authoresses in
her time, and knew that they were as a rule most ordinary,
hum-drum kind of people, was quite prepared for her fate.&nbsp;
She remembered her astonishment as a girl when, having laughed
and cried at the play, and taken the chief actor as her ideal
hero, she had had him pointed out to her one day in Regent
Street, and found him to be a most commonplace-looking man, the
very last person one would have supposed capable of stirring the
hearts of a great audience.</p>
<p>Meanwhile dinner progressed, and Mrs. Selldon talked to an
empty-headed but loquacious man on her left, and racked her
brains for something to say to the alarmingly silent author on
her right.&nbsp; She remembered hearing that Charles Dickens
would often sit silent through the whole of dinner, observing
quietly those about him, but that at dessert he would suddenly
come to life and keep the whole table in roars of laughter.&nbsp;
She feared that Mr. Shrewsbury meant to imitate the great
novelist in the first particular, but was scarcely likely to
follow his example in the last.&nbsp; At length she asked him
what he thought of the cathedral, and a few tepid remarks
followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How unutterably this good lady bores me!&rdquo; thought
the author.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How odd it is that his characters talk so well in his
books, and that he is such a stick!&rdquo; thought Mrs.
Selldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s the effect of cathedral-town
atmosphere,&rdquo; reflected the author.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he is eaten up with conceit and won&rsquo;t
trouble himself to talk to me,&rdquo; thought the hostess.</p>
<p>By the time the fish had been removed they had arrived at a
state of mutual contempt.&nbsp; Mindful of the reputation they
had to keep up, however, they exerted themselves a little more
while the <i>entr&eacute;es</i> went round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seldom reads, I should fancy, and never thinks!&rdquo;
reflected the author, glancing at Mrs. Selldon&rsquo;s placid
unintellectual face.&nbsp; &ldquo;What on earth can I say to
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very unpractical, I am sure,&rdquo; reflected Mrs.
Selldon.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sort of man who lives in a world of his
own, and only lays down his pen to take up a book.&nbsp; What
subject shall I start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What delightful weather we have been having the last
few days!&rdquo; observed the author.&nbsp; &ldquo;Real genuine
summer weather at last.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same remark had been
trembling on Mrs. Selldon&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; She assented with
great cheerfulness and alacrity; and over that invaluable topic,
which is always so safe, and so congenial, and so ready to hand,
they grew quite friendly, and the conversation for fully five
minutes was animated.</p>
<p>An interval of thought followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wearisome is society!&rdquo; reflected Mrs.
Selldon.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is hard that we must spend so much money
in giving dinners and have so much trouble for so little
enjoyment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One pays dearly for fame,&rdquo; reflected the
author.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a confounded nuisance it is to waste
all this time when there are the last proofs of &lsquo;What
Caste?&rsquo; to be done for the nine-o&rsquo;clock post
to-morrow morning!&nbsp; Goodness knows what time I shall get to
bed to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Selldon thought regretfully of the comfortable easy
chair that she usually enjoyed after dinner, and the ten
minutes&rsquo; nap, and the congenial needle-work.&nbsp; And Mark
Shrewsbury thought of his chambers in Pump Court, and longed for
his type-writer, and his books, and his swivel chair, and his
favourite meerschaum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be less afraid to talk if there were not
always the horrible idea that he may take down what one
says,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Selldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be less bored if she would only be her natural
self,&rdquo; reflected the author.&nbsp; &ldquo;And would not
talk prim platitudes.&rdquo;&nbsp; (This was hard, for he had
talked nothing else himself.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Does she think she is
so interesting that I am likely to study her for my next
book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been abroad this summer?&rdquo; inquired Mrs.
Selldon, making another spasmodic attempt at conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I detest travelling,&rdquo; replied Mark
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I need change I just settle down in
some quiet country district for a few months&mdash;somewhere near
Windsor, or Reigate, or Muddleton.&nbsp; There is nothing to my
mind like our English scenery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you know Muddleton?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Selldon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it not a charming little place?&nbsp; I
often stay in the neighbourhood with the
Milton-Cleaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Milton-Cleave well,&rdquo; said the
author.&nbsp; &ldquo;A capital fellow, quite the typical country
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he not?&rdquo; said Mrs. Selldon, much relieved to
have found this subject in common.&nbsp; &ldquo;His wife is a
great friend of mine; she is full of life and energy, and does an
immense amount of good.&nbsp; Did you say you had stayed with
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but last year I took a house in that neighbourhood
for a few months; a most charming little place it was, just fit
for a lonely bachelor.&nbsp; I dare say you remember it&mdash;Ivy
Cottage, on the Newton Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you stay there?&nbsp; Now what a curious
coincidence!&nbsp; Only this morning I heard from Mrs.
Milton-Cleave that Ivy Cottage has been taken this summer by a
Mr. Sigismund Zaluski, a Polish merchant, who is doing untold
harm in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; He is a very clever,
unscrupulous man, and has managed to take in almost every
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is he?&nbsp; A swindler?&nbsp; Or a burglar
in disguise, like the <i>House on the Marsh</i> fellow?&rdquo;
asked the author, with a little twinkle of amusement in his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, much worse than that,&rdquo; said Mrs. Selldon,
lowering her voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I assure you, Mr. Shrewsbury,
you would hardly credit the story if I were to tell it you, it is
really stranger than fiction.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark Shrewsbury
pricked up his ears, he no longer felt bored, he began to think
that, after all, there might be some compensation for this
wearisome dinner-party.&nbsp; He was always glad to seize upon
material for future plots, and somehow the notion of a mysterious
Pole suddenly making his appearance in that quiet country
neighbourhood and winning undeserved popularity rather took his
fancy.&nbsp; He thought he might make something of it.&nbsp;
However, he knew human nature too well to ask a direct
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to hear that,&rdquo; he said, becoming all
at once quite sympathetic and approachable.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like the thought of those simple, unsophisticated
people being hoodwinked by a scoundrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; is it not sad?&rdquo; said Mrs. Selldon.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Such pleasant, hospitable people as they are!&nbsp; Do you
remember the Morleys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&nbsp; There was a pretty daughter who played
tennis well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so&mdash;Gertrude Morley.&nbsp; Well, would you
believe it, this miserable fortune-hunter is actually either
engaged to her or on the eve of being engaged!&nbsp; Poor Mrs.
Milton-Cleave is so unhappy about it, for she knows, on the best
authority, that Mr. Zaluski is unfit to enter a respectable
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is really some escaped criminal?&rdquo;
suggested Mr. Shrewsbury, tentatively.</p>
<p>Mrs. Selldon hesitated.&nbsp; Then, under the cover of the
general roar of conversation, she said in a low voice:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have guessed quite rightly.&nbsp; He is one of the
Nihilists who were concerned in the assassination of the late
Czar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; exclaimed Mark
Shrewsbury, much startled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it
possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, it is only too true,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Selldon.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard it only the other morning, and on
the very best authority.&nbsp; Poor Gertrude Morley!&nbsp; My
heart bleeds for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I can&rsquo;t help observing here that this must have been
the merest figure of speech, for just then there was a
comfortable little glow of satisfaction about Mrs.
Selldon&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; She was so delighted to have
&ldquo;got on well,&rdquo; as she expressed it, with the literary
lion, and by this time dessert was on the table, and soon the
tedious ceremony would be happily over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did he escape?&rdquo; asked Mark Shrewsbury,
still with the thought of &ldquo;copy&rdquo; in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the details,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Selldon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Probably they are only known to
himself.&nbsp; But he managed to escape somehow in the month of
March 1881, and to reach England safely.&nbsp; I fear it is only
too often the case in this world&mdash;wickedness is apt to be
successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To flourish like a green bay tree,&rdquo; said Mark
Shrewsbury, congratulating himself on the aptness of the
quotation, and its suitability to the Archediaconal
dinner-table.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the strangest story I have heard
for a long time.&rdquo;&nbsp; Just then there was a pause in the
general conversation, and Mrs. Selldon took advantage of it to
make the sign for rising, so that no more passed with regard to
Zaluski.</p>
<p>Shrewsbury, flattering himself that he had left a good
impression by his last remark, thought better not to efface it
later in the evening by any other conversation with his
hostess.&nbsp; But in the small hours of the night, when he had
finished his bundle of proofs, he took up his notebook and,
strangling his yawns, made two or three brief, pithy notes of the
story Mrs. Selldon had told him, adding a further development
which occurred to him, and wondering to himself whether
&ldquo;Like a Green Bay Tree&rdquo; would be a selling title.</p>
<p>After this he went to bed, and slept the sleep of the just, or
the unbroken sleep which goes by that name.</p>
<h2>MY SIXTH STAGE</h2>
<blockquote><p>But whispering tongues can poison truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span

</blockquote>
<p>London in early September is a somewhat trying place.&nbsp;
Mark Shrewsbury found it less pleasing in reality than in his
visions during the dinner-party at Dulminster.&nbsp; True, his
chambers were comfortable, and his type-writer was as invaluable
a machine as ever, and his novel was drawing to a successful
conclusion; but though all these things were calculated to cheer
him, he was nevertheless depressed.&nbsp; Town was dull, the heat
was trying, and he had never in his life found it so difficult to
settle down to work.&nbsp; He began to agree with the Preacher,
that &ldquo;of making many books there is no end,&rdquo; and
that, in spite of his favourite &ldquo;Remington&rsquo;s
perfected No. 2,&rdquo; novel-writing was a weariness to the
flesh.&nbsp; Soon he drifted into a sort of vague idleness, which
was not a good, honest holiday, but just a lazy waste of time and
brains.&nbsp; I was pleased to observe this, and was not slow to
take advantage of it.&nbsp; Had he stayed in Pump Court he might
have forgotten me altogether in his work, but in the soft luxury
of his Club life I found that I had a very fair chance of being
passed on to some one else.</p>
<p>One hot afternoon, on waking from a comfortable nap in the
depths of an armchair at the Club, Shrewsbury was greeted by one
of his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were in Switzerland, old fellow!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, yawning and stretching himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came back yesterday&mdash;awfully bad
season&mdash;confoundedly dull,&rdquo; returned the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with Warren near Dulminster.&nbsp; Deathly dull
hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do for your next novel.&nbsp; Eh?&rdquo; said the other
with a laugh.</p>
<p>Mark Shrewsbury smiled good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking of novels,&rdquo; he observed, with another
yawn, &ldquo;I heard such a story down there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s hear it.&nbsp; A nice little
scandal would do instead of a pick-me-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a scandal.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t raise your
expectations.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the story of a successful
scoundrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I came out again in full vigour&mdash;nay, with
vastly increased powers; for though Mark Shrewsbury did not add
very much to me, or alter my appearance, yet his graphic words
made me much more impressive than I had been under the management
of Mrs. Selldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! that&rsquo;s a queer story,&rdquo; said the
limp-looking young man from Switzerland.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say, have
a game of billiards, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shrewsbury, with prodigious yawn, dragged himself up out of
his chair, and the two went off together.&nbsp; As they left the
room the only other man present looked up from his newspaper,
following them with his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shrewsbury the novelist,&rdquo; he thought to
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;A sterling fellow!&nbsp; And he heard it
from an Archdeacon&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Confound it all! the thing
must be true then.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll write and make full inquiries
about this Zaluski before consenting to the
engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, being a prompt, business-like man, Gertrude
Morley&rsquo;s uncle sat down and wrote the following letter to a
Russian friend of his who lived at St. Petersburg, and who might
very likely be able to give some account of Zaluski:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Leonoff,&mdash;Some very queer stories are
afloat about a young Polish merchant, by name Sigismund Zaluski,
the head of the London branch of the firm of Zaluski and Zernoff,
at St. Petersburg.&nbsp; Will you kindly make inquiries for me as
to his true character and history?&nbsp; I would not trouble you
with this affair, but the fact is Zaluski has made an offer of
marriage to one of my wards, and before consenting to any
betrothal I must know what sort of man he really is.&nbsp; I take
it for granted that &ldquo;there is no smoke without fire,&rdquo;
and that there must be something in the very strange tale which I
have just heard on the best authority.&nbsp; It is said that this
Sigismund Zaluski left St. Petersburg in March 1881, after the
assassination of the late Czar, in which he was seriously
compromised.&nbsp; He is said to be an out-and-out Nihilist, an
atheist, and, in short, a dangerous, disreputable fellow.&nbsp;
Will you sift the matter for me?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to
dismiss the fellow without good reason, but of course I could not
think of permitting him to be engaged to my niece until these
charges are entirely disproved.</p>
<p>With kind remembrances to your father,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am, yours faithfully<br />

And the cruel echo answered<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Curiously enough, I must actually have started for Russia on
the same day that Sigismund Zaluski was summoned by his uncle at
St. Petersburg to return on a matter of urgent business.&nbsp; I
learnt afterwards that the telegram arrived at Muddleton on the
afternoon of one of those sunny September days and found Zaluski
as usual at the Morleys.&nbsp; He was very much annoyed at being
called away just then, and before he had received any reply from
Gertrude&rsquo;s uncle as to the engagement.&nbsp; However, after
a little ebullition of anger, he regained his usual philosophic
tone, and, reminding Gertrude that he need not be away from
England for more than a fortnight, he took leave of her and set
off in a prompt, manly fashion, leaving most of his belongings at
Ivy Cottage, which was his for another six weeks, and to which he
hoped shortly to return.</p>
<p>After a weary time of imprisonment in my envelope, I at length
reached my destination at St. Petersburg and was read by Dmitry
Leonoff.&nbsp; He was a very busy man, and by the same post
received dozens of other letters.&nbsp; He merely
muttered&mdash;&ldquo;That well-known firm!&nbsp; A most unlikely
story!&rdquo;&mdash;and then thrust me into a drawer with other
letters which had to be answered.&nbsp; Very probably I escaped
his memory altogether for the next few days: however, there I
was&mdash;a startling accusation in black and white; and, as
everybody knows, St. Petersburg is not London.</p>
<p>The Leonoff family lived on the third storey of a large block
of buildings in the Sergeffskaia.&nbsp; About two o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, on the third day after my arrival, the whole
household was roused from sleep by thundering raps on the door,
and the dreaded cry of &ldquo;Open to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unlucky master was forced to allow himself, his wife, and
his children to be made prisoners, while every corner of the
house was searched and every book and paper examined.</p>
<p>Leonoff had nothing whatever to do with the Revolutionary
movement, but absolute innocence does not free people from the
police inquisition, and five or six years ago, when the Search
mania was at its height, a case is on record of a poor lady whose
house was searched seven times within twenty-four hours, though
there was no evidence whatever that she was connected with the
Nihilists; the whole affair was, in fact, a misunderstanding, as
she was perfectly innocent.</p>
<p>This search in Dmitry Leonoff&rsquo;s house was also a
misunderstanding, and in the dominions of the Czar
misunderstandings are of frequent occurrence.</p>
<p>Leonoff knew himself to be innocent, and he felt no fear,
though considerable annoyance, while the search was prosecuted;
he could hardly believe the evidence of his senses when, without
a word of explanation, he was informed that he must take leave of
his wife and children, and go in charge of the gendarmes to the
House of Preventive Detention.</p>
<p>Being a sensible man, he kept his temper, remarked courteously
that some mistake must have been made, embraced his weeping wife,
and went off passively, while the pristav carried away a bundle
of letters in which I occupied the most prominent place.</p>
<p>Leonoff remained a prisoner only for a few days; there was not
a shred of evidence against him, and, having suffered terrible
anxiety, he was finally released.&nbsp; But Mr.
Crichton-Morley&rsquo;s letter was never restored to him, it
remained in the hands of the authorities, and the night after
Leonoff&rsquo;s arrest the pristav, the procurator, and the
gendarmes made their way into the dwelling of Sigismund
Zaluski&rsquo;s uncle, where a similar search was prosecuted.</p>
<p>Sigismund was asleep and dreaming of Gertrude and of his
idyllic summer in England, when his bedroom door was forced open
and he was roughly roused by the gendarmes.</p>
<p>His first feeling was one of amazement, his second, one of
indignation; however, he was obliged to get up at once and dress,
the policeman rigorously keeping guard over him the whole time
for fear he should destroy any treasonable document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I shall make them laugh in England when I tell them
of this ridiculous affair!&rdquo; reflected Sigismund, as he was
solemnly marched into the adjoining room, where he found his
uncle and cousins, each guarded by a policeman.</p>
<p>He made some jesting remark, but was promptly reprimanded by
his gaoler, and in wearisome silence the household waited while
the most rigorous search of the premises was made.</p>
<p>Of course nothing was found; but, to the amazement of all,
Sigismund was formally arrested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some mistake,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;I have been resident in England for some time.&nbsp; I
have no connection whatever with Russian politics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we are well aware of your residence in
England,&rdquo; said the pristav.&nbsp; &ldquo;You left St.
Petersburg early in March 1881.&nbsp; We are well aware of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the man&rsquo;s tone made Sigismund&rsquo;s heart
stand still.&nbsp; Could he possibly be suspected of complicity
in the plot to assassinate the late Czar?&nbsp; The idea would
have made him laugh had he been in England.&nbsp; In St.
Petersburg, and under these circumstances, it made him
tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some terrible mistake,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have never had the slightest connection with the
revolutionary party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pristav shrugged his shoulders, and Sigismund, feeling
like one in a dream, took leave of his relations, and was
escorted at once to the House of Preventive Detention.</p>
<p>Arrived at his destination, he was examined in a brief,
unsatisfactory way; but when he angrily asked for the evidence on
which he had been arrested, he was merely told that information
had been received charging him with being concerned in the
assassination of the late Emperor, and of being an advanced
member of the Nihilist party.&nbsp; His vehement denials were
received with scornful incredulity, his departure for England
just after the assassination, and his prolonged absence from
Russia, of course gave colour to the accusation, and he was
ordered off to his cell &ldquo;to reflect.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>MY TRIUMPHANT FINALE</h2>
<blockquote><p>Words are mighty, words are living;<br />
Serpents with their venomous stings,<br />
Or bright angels crowding round us,<br />
With heaven&rsquo;s light upon their wings;<br />
Every word has its own spirit,<br />
True or false, that never dies;<br />
Every word man&rsquo;s lips have uttered<br />
Echoes in God&rsquo;s skies.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>My labours were now nearly at an end, and being, so to speak,
off duty, I could occupy myself just as I pleased.&nbsp; I
therefore resolved to keep watch over Zaluski in his prison.</p>
<p>For the first few hours after his arrest he was in a violent
passion; he paced up and down his tiny cell like a lion in a
cage; he was beside himself with indignation, and the blood leapt
through his veins like wildfire.</p>
<p>Then he became a little ashamed of himself and tried to grow
quiet, and after a sleepless night he passed to the opposite
extreme and sat all day long on the solitary stool in his grim
abode, his head resting on his hands, and his mind a prey to the
most fearful melancholy.</p>
<p>The second night, however, he slept, and awoke with a steady
resolve in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will never do to give way like this, or I shall be
in a brain fever in no time,&rdquo; he reflected.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will get leave to have books and writing materials.&nbsp; I will
make the best of a bad business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remembered how pleased he had been when Gertrude had once
smiled on him because, when all the others in the party were
grumbling at the discomforts of a certain picnic where the
provisions had gone astray, he had gaily made the best of it and
ransacked the nearest cottages for bread-and-cheese.&nbsp; He set
to work bravely now; hoped daily for his release; read all the
books he was allowed to receive, invented solitary games, began a
novel, and drew caricatures.</p>
<p>In October he was again examined; but, having nothing to
reveal, it was inevitable that he could reveal nothing; and he
was again sent back to his cell &ldquo;to reflect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I perceived that after this his heart began to fail him.</p>
<p>There existed in the House of Preventive Detention a system of
communication between the luckless prisoners carried on by means
of tapping on the wall.&nbsp; Sigismund, being a clever fellow,
had become a great adept at this telegraphic system, and had
struck up a friendship with a young student in the next cell;
this poor fellow had been imprisoned three years, his sole
offence being that he had in his possession a book of which the
Government did not approve, and that he was first cousin to a
well-known Nihilist.</p>
<p>The two became as devoted to each other as Silvio Pellico and
Count Oroboni; but it soon became evident to Valerian Vasilowitch
that, unless Zaluski was released, he would soon succumb to the
terrible restrictions of prison life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep up your heart, my friend,&rdquo; he used to
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have borne it three years, and am still alive
to tell the tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are stronger both in mind and body,&rdquo; said
Sigismund; &ldquo;and you are not madly in love as I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he would pour forth a rhapsody about Gertrude, and
about English life, and about his hopes and fears for the future;
to all of which Valerian, like the brave fellow he was, replied
with words of encouragement.</p>
<p>But at length there came a day when his friend made no answer
to his usual morning greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>For some time there was no reply, but after a while Sigismund
rapped faintly the despairing words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead beat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valerian felt the tears start to his eyes.&nbsp; It was what
he had all along expected, and for a time grief and indignation
and his miserable helplessness made him almost beside
himself.&nbsp; At last he remembered that there was at least one
thing in his power.&nbsp; Each day he was escorted by a warder to
a tiny square, walled off in the exercising ground, and was
allowed to walk for a few minutes; he would take this opportunity
of begging the warder to get the doctor for his friend.</p>
<p>But unfortunately the doctor did not think very seriously of
Zaluski&rsquo;s case.&nbsp; In that dreary prison he had patients
in the last stages of all kinds of disease, and Sigismund, who
had been in confinement too short a time to look as ill as the
others, did not receive much attention.&nbsp; Certainly, the
doctor admitted, his lungs were affected; probably the sudden
change of climate and the lack of good food and fresh air had
been too much for him; so the solemn farce ended, and he was left
to his fate.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I were indeed a Nihilist, and
suffered for a cause which I had at heart,&rdquo; he telegraphed
to Valerian, &ldquo;I could bear it better.&nbsp; But to be kept
here for an imaginary offence, to bear cold and hunger and
illness all to no purpose&mdash;that beats me.&nbsp; There
can&rsquo;t be a God, or such things would not be
allowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me it seems,&rdquo; said Valerian, &ldquo;that we
are the victims of violated law.&nbsp; Others have shown tyranny,
or injustice, or cruelty, and we are the victims of their
sin.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say there is no God.&nbsp; There must be a
God to avenge such hideous wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they spoke to each other through their prison wall as men
in the free outer world seldom care to speak; and I, who knew no
barriers, looked now on Valerian&rsquo;s gaunt figure, and brave
but prematurely old face, now on poor Zaluski, who, in his weary
imprisonment, had wasted away till one could scarcely believe
that he was indeed the same lithe, active fellow who had played
tennis at Mrs. Courtenay&rsquo;s garden-party.</p>
<p>Day and night Valerian listened to the terrible cough which
came from the adjoining cell.&nbsp; It became perfectly apparent
to him that his friend was dying; he knew it as well as if he had
seen the burning hectic flush on his hollow cheeks, and heard the
panting, hurried breaths, and watched the unnatural brilliancy of
his dark eyes.</p>
<p>At length he thought the time had come for another sort of
comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said one day, &ldquo;it is too
plain to me now that you are dying.&nbsp; Write to the procurator
and tell him so.&nbsp; In some cases men have been allowed to go
home to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wild hope seized on poor Sigismund; he sat down to the
little table in his cell and wrote a letter to the
procurator&mdash;a letter which might almost have drawn tears
from a flint.&nbsp; Again and again he passionately asserted his
innocence, and begged to know on what evidence he was
imprisoned.&nbsp; He began to think that he could die content if
he might leave this terrible cell, might be a free agent once
more, if only for a few days.&nbsp; At least he might in that
case clear his character, and convince Gertrude that his
imprisonment had been all a hideous mistake; nay, he fancied that
he might live through a journey to England and see her once
again.</p>
<p>But the procurator would not let him be set free, and refused
to believe that his case was really a serious one.</p>
<p>Sigismund&rsquo;s last hope left him.</p>
<p>The days and weeks dragged slowly on, and when, according to
English reckoning, New Year&rsquo;s Eve arrived, he could
scarcely believe that only seventeen weeks ago he had actually
been with Gertrude, and that disgrace and imprisonment had seemed
things that could never come near him, and death had been a
far-away possibility, and life had been full of bliss.</p>
<p>As I watched him a strong desire seized me to revisit the
scenes of which he was thinking, and I winged my way back to
England, and soon found myself in the drowsy, respectable streets
of Muddleton.</p>
<p>It was New Year&rsquo;s Eve, and I saw Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly
preparing presents for her grandchildren, and talking, as she
tied them up, of that dreadful Nihilist who had deceived them in
the summer.&nbsp; I saw Lena Houghton, and Mr. Blackthorne, and
Mrs. Milton-Cleave, kneeling in church on that Friday morning,
praying that pity might be shown &ldquo;upon all prisoners and
captives, and all that are desolate or oppressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It never occurred to them that they were responsible for the
sufferings of one weary prisoner, or that his death would be laid
at their door.</p>
<p>I flew to Dulminster, and saw Mrs. Selldon kneeling in the
cathedral at the late evening service and rigorously examining
herself as to the shortcomings of the dying year.&nbsp; She
confessed many things in a vague, untroubled way; but had any one
told her that she had cruelly wronged her neighbour, and helped
to bring an innocent man to shame, and prison, and death, she
would not have believed the accusation.</p>
<p>I sought out Mark Shrewsbury.&nbsp; He was at his chambers in
Pump Court working away with his type-writer; he had a fancy for
working the old year out and the new year in, and now he was in
the full swing of that novel which had suggested itself to his
mind when Mrs. Selldon described the rich and mysterious
foreigner who had settled down at Ivy Cottage.&nbsp; Most happily
he laboured on, never dreaming that his careless words had doomed
a fellow-man to a painful and lingering death; never dreaming
that while his fingers flew to and fro over his dainty little
keyboard, describing the clever doings of the unscrupulous
foreigner, another man, the victim of his idle gossip, tapped
dying messages on a dreary prison wall.</p>
<p>For the end had come.</p>
<p>Through the evening Sigismund rested wearily on his
truckle-bed.&nbsp; He could not lie down because of his cough,
and, since there were no extra pillows to prop him up, he had to
rest his head and shoulders against the wall.&nbsp; There was a
gas-burner in the tiny cell, and by its light he looked round the
bare walls of his prison with a blank, hopeless, yet wistful
gaze; there was the stool, there was the table, there were the
clothes he should never wear again, there was the door through
which his lifeless body would soon be carried.&nbsp; He looked at
everything lingeringly, for he knew that this desolate prison was
the last bit of the world he should ever see.</p>
<p>Presently the gas was turned out.</p>
<p>He sighed as he felt the darkness close in upon him, for he
knew that his eyes would never again see light&mdash;knew that in
this dark lonely cell he must lie and wait for death.&nbsp; And
he was young and wished to live, and he was in love and longed
most terribly for the presence of the woman he loved.</p>
<p>The awful desolateness of the cell was more than he could
endure; he tried to think of his past life, he tried to live once
again through those happy weeks with Gertrude; but always he came
back to the aching misery of the present&mdash;the cold and the
pain, and the darkness and the terrible solitude.</p>
<p>His nerveless fingers felt their way to the wall and faintly
rapped a summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valerian!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall not live
through the night.&nbsp; Watch with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faint raps sounded clearly in the stillness of the great
building, and Valerian dreaded lest the warders should hear them,
and deal out punishment for an offence which by day they were
forced to wink at.</p>
<p>But he would not for the world have deserted his friend.&nbsp;
He drew his stool close to the wall, wrapped himself round in all
the clothes he could muster, and, shivering with cold, kept watch
through the long winter night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am near you,&rdquo; he telegraphed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will watch with you till morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From time to time Sigismund rapped faint messages, and
Valerian replied with comfort and sympathy.&nbsp; Once he thought
to himself, &ldquo;My friend is better; there is more power in
his hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; And indeed he trembled, fearing that the
sharp, emphatic raps must certainly attract notice and put an end
to their communion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell my love that the accusation was
false&mdash;false!&rdquo; the word was vehemently repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell her I died broken-hearted, loving her to the
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell her all when I am free,&rdquo; said poor
Valerian, wondering with a sigh when his unjust imprisonment
would end.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you suffer much?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>There was a brief interval.&nbsp; Sigismund hesitated to tell
a falsehood in his last extremity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will soon be over.&nbsp; Do not be troubled for
me,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; And after that there was a long,
long silence.</p>
<p>Poor fellow! he died hard; and I wished that those comfortable
English people could have been dragged from their warm beds and
brought into the cold dreary cell where their victim lay,
fighting for breath, suffering cruelly both in mind and
body.&nbsp; Valerian, listening in sad suspense, heard one more
faint word rapped by the dying man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be with you!&rdquo; he replied, unable to check the
tears which rained down as he thought of the life so sadly ended,
and of his own bereavement.</p>
<p>He heard no more.&nbsp; Sigismund&rsquo;s strength failed him,
and I, to whom the darkness made no difference, watched him
through the last dread struggle; there was no one to raise him,
or hold him, no one to comfort him.&nbsp; Alone in the cold and
darkness of that first morning of the year 1887, he died.</p>
<p>Valerian did not hear through the wall his last faint gasping
cry, but I heard it, and its exceeding bitterness would have made
mortals weep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gertrude!&rdquo; he sobbed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gertrude!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that his head sank on his breast, and the life, which
but for me might have been so happy and prosperous, was
ended.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Prompted by curiosity, I instantly returned to Muddleton and
sought out Gertrude Morley.&nbsp; I stole into her room.&nbsp;
She lay asleep, but her dreams were troubled, and her face, once
so fresh and bright, was worn with pain and anxiety.</p>
<p>Scarcely had I entered the room when, to my amazement, I saw
the spirit of Sigismund Zaluski.</p>
<p>I saw him bend down and kiss the sleeping girl, and for a
moment her sad face lighted up with a radiant smile.</p>
<p>I looked again; he was gone.&nbsp; Then Gertrude threw up both
her arms and with a bitter cry awoke from her dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sigismund!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
Sigismund!&nbsp; Now I know that you are dead indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long, long time she lay in a sort of trance of
misery.&nbsp; It seemed as if the life had been almost crushed
out of her, and it was not until the bells began to ring for the
six o&rsquo;clock service, merrily pealing out their welcome of
the new year morning, that full consciousness returned to her
again.&nbsp; But, as she clearly realised what had happened, she
broke into such a passion of tears as I had never before
witnessed, while still in the darkness the new year bells rang
gaily, and she knew that they heralded for her the beginning of a
lonely life.</p>
<p>And so my work ended; my part in this world was played
out.&nbsp; Nevertheless I still live; and there will come a day
when Sigismund and Gertrude shall be comforted and the slanderers
punished.</p>
<p>For poor Valerian was right, and there is an Avenger, in whom
even my progenitor believes, and before whom he trembles.</p>
<p>There will come a time when those self-satisfied ones, whose
hands are all the time steeped in blood, shall be confronted with
me, and shall realise to the full all that their idle words have
brought about.</p>
<p>For that day I wait; and though afterwards I shall be finally
destroyed in the general destruction of all that is unmitigatedly
evil, I promise myself a certain satisfaction and pleasure (a
feeling I doubtless inherit from my progenitor), when I watch the
shame, and horror, and remorse of Mrs. O&rsquo;Reilly and the
rest of the people to whom I owe my existence and rapid
growth.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
